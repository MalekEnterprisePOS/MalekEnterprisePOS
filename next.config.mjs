  // shipped in /public) was going through Vercel's Image Optimization pipeline by default. That
  // pipeline has its own separate usage allowance from the rest of Hobby-plan hosting, and once a
  // project runs past it, Vercel starts returning 402 Payment Required for every further
  // optimization request - which is exactly the recurring "Failed to load resource: 402" seen on
  // every page, and why the logo rendered as its own alt text instead of the actual image.
  // There's nothing to optimize here anyway (one small fixed-size asset, not a gallery of
  // variable/user-uploaded images), so this turns optimization off entirely and serves the file
  // as a plain static asset - faster (no per-request transform) and immune to this billing wall.
